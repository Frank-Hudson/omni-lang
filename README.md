# Omni-lang Programming Language

The Omni programming language is a work-in-progress language based on the style, syntax and features of [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Lisp](https://lisp-lang.org), in order to create something else new and exciting.

This is a project I started as a fun idea in the autumn of 2023, as of this first upload (2024-03-14), I still do not plan on creating the compiler in the forseeable future. For now, I will continue to work on the syntax, features and (make-believe) builtins.

If you wish to contribute or to try and create your own compiler for the language, you are welcome to do so.
